### 👨‍💻 About Me
I specialize in building extreme-density, **zero-allocation** infrastructure for the JVM. I believe that modern hardware is constantly bottlenecked by legacy software patterns. My mission is to rip out unnecessary abstractions, bypass the Garbage Collector, and write Java that respects the CPU cache.

- 🔭 **Currently Building:** [Exeris Kernel](https://github.com/arkstack-dev/exeris-kernel) — a zero-copy, off-heap runtime built for Java 26+.
- ⚙️ **Tech Focus:** Project Panama (FFM), Project Loom (Virtual Threads), `io_uring`, ZGC, Off-Heap Memory Management.
- 🗡️ **Coding Philosophy:** *"Any allocation on the hot path is a failure of the design."* (The Trafalgar Law approach to memory manipulation).

### ✍️ Latest Engineering Articles
I write deeply technical deep-dives on my blog at **[blog.arkstack.dev](https://blog.arkstack.dev)**.
